# sentiment
A Valentine's Day gift.

## Information
Sentiment is built using Angular2 and AngularFire, a library meant to connect Angular to Firebase. It is hosted as a Firebase app, and was built as a gift for my wonderful girlfriend. The password system uses SHA-1 hash encryption for security.

## What it does
Sentiment is a modern-day form of note-passing. The point of Sentiment is to be pleasantly surprised when your partner leaves you a note - there's no notification when it occurs, so occasionally, you'll log in and see that they've left you a note! You can only read what they write for you, but you can edit what they will see when logging in. The app was built with a minimalist theme in mind - it's meant to convey a simplistic intimacy, as it's a system built with only two users in mind.
